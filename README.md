I am currently a Final-year [AIML](https://www.sanjayghodawatuniversity.ac.in/dept-aiml) B.tech student at the [Sanjay Ghodawat University](https://www.sanjayghodawatuniversity.ac.in/). <!--  I specialize in understanding and working with different sensing modalities. This requires me to work in pretty diverse fields: Computer Vision, NLU, 3D Vision, Causal Inference, Compressed Sensing, Human-Computer Interaction, and more... I keep on trying to decide on a sub-domain to focus on, but problems with real-world applications of AI/Stats are too many to ignore! So for now, I'll continue to pretend that I work on <b>Interdisciplinary AI :)</b>  -->

I always look for exciting opportunities, so do drop by if you want to discuss!

I live on the internet.
